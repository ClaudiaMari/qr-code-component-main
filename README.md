## My process

I started by building the gross structure and then focused on styling it until it resembled the given design pictures. The biggest problem that i encountered was centering the content both horizontaly and verticaly within the page. This I solved by putting everything inside a box container with height of 98vh and 100vw and using display flex on the outer div - .box and the inner one - .conainer

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

In my future projects I want to foccus my atention in positioning the ellements within the page and the viewport since I feel that I will manage to have a better understanding over and master using positioning, transform, display (block, table, flex, grid, etc. ) only by practicing and coding more.
